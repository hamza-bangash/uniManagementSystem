#  Student Management System (C++ Project)

This is a simple console-based **Student Management System** implemented in **C++** as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course during the 2nd semester at FAST-NUCES. The system allows interaction between students, faculty, and administrative users via a file-based login system, enabling management of academic records.
